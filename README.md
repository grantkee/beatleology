# Beatleology

###### Which Beatle are you?

Beatleology is a book written by Adam Jaquette and Roger Jaquette:

> The tenets of Beatleology are simple: We all have an Inner Beatle guiding our destiny and governing our behavior. Forget Leo or Taurus. This book teaches us that it’s more accurate to say, “I’m a John” or “I’m a Ringo.” A simple personality test determines who your Inner Beatle is and how you will interact with the other Johns, Pauls, Georges, and Ringos of the world—at home, at work, and on the street. Written in the spirit of our favorite “cheeky lads from Liverpool,” This guide is pop psychology with a twist—and a dash of Sgt. Pepper.

###### Objective

I want to help others identify their inner Beatle with a simple quiz made using React. I do not own any of the material in the quiz. I simply organized it as a side project to practice my own coding skills. Please enjoy! If you find this app amusing, please support the authors by purchasing a copy of their book. They provide much more insight and information that's waiting for you to discover.
